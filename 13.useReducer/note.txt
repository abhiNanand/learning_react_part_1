UseReducer
___________


Reducer is a pure function that determines how the state of an applicaiton should change in response to an action.  
reducer pattern:
(state,action)=>new State )

How does a reducer work?
It takes the current state and an action as arguments.
It processes the action and returns a new state based on the action type.
The state is immutable, meaning it does not modify the existing state but returns a new state object.

useState and useReducer looks similar in some ways.


How Does useReducer Compare to the useState Hook?
-They both involve a current state value, and have a function that triggers  a state update and an initial state value passed as an argument.

-The useReducer is an alternative to the useState hook for managing state in functional components. 

-The useReducer hook is better suited for managing complex state logic while useState is best for simple state changes.

=============================================================================

Why we use useReducer 

When the state logic becomes too complicated or when you need to handle state changes in more predictable and manageable way,the useReducer hook is best for this.

What is useReducer?

const [state,dispatch] = useReducer(reducer, initialState);

-a useReducer is a hook in react that allows you to add reducer to your component.
-takes reducer function and initailState as argument. 
-return array of the current state and a dispatch function.

const [state,dispatch] = useReducer(reducer,initialState)
~state: represent the current value.

~dispatch: is a function send action to reducer. 

~reducer:  function that updates state based on action. updated. . It takes state and action as arguments and returns the next state.
The reducer function is always declared outside of your component and takes in a current state and action as arguments.

function reducer(state,action)
{

}

~initialState: house the initial value can be of any type.

reducer: is a function that house  all the logic of how the state gets updated. . It takes state and action as arguments and returns the next state.
The reducer function is always declared outside of your component and takes in a current state and action as arguments.

function reducer(state,action)
{
    
}
An action is an object that typically has a type property which identifies a specific action. Actions describe what happens and contains information necessary for the reducer to update the state.

Conditional statements are used to check the action types and perform a specified operation that would return a new state value. Conditional statements like if and switch can be used in reducers.

in use state:

const [name, setName] = useState("");
  const [email, setEmail] = useState("");
  const [error, setError] = useState("");


  in useReducer

  1 se hi ho jayega. 

  const initialState = {
  name: "",
  email: "",
  error: "",
};

also use state use when states dependes on previous state. 
involve multiple actions.

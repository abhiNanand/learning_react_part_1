What is Babel?
Bable is a javascript compiler that translate modern Javascript (ES6+)  code into older javascript that browser can understand.

Why babel needed?
React uses JSX(Javascript XML) which broweser don't understand natively.
Babel converts JSX into standard Js, so broweser can run it.

üìå How Babel Works in React
1Ô∏è‚É£ JSX Conversion
React code uses JSX, which looks like this:
const element=<h1>Hello, React! </h1>

browser dont't understand JSX, do babel converts it into this. 
const element = React.createElement("h1", null, "Hello, React!");

2Ô∏è‚É£ Converts ES6+ Features
Babel also converts modern JavaScript (like let, const, arrow functions) into older versions for better browser support.

Babel converts it into:
var greet = function() {
  console.log("Hello!");
};
Now, old browsers can understand it!


 
Babel with Webpack in React
When you create a React app with npx create-react-app, Babel is already set up inside Webpack.

Babel uses presets to define which transformations should be applied:

@babel/preset-react ‚Üí Converts JSX
@babel/preset-env ‚Üí Converts modern JS

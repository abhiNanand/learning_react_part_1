what is vite?
Vite is a modern build tool that is  much faster than traditional bundlers like webpack. 
 It is optimized for speed and efficiency when developing React, Vue, and other JavaScript applications.

 ðŸ”¹ Why Do We Use Vite?
Webpack is great but slow during development because it bundles everything before starting the server. Vite is super fast because it does not bundle files upfront.

Vite uses ES Modules (ESM) and Hot Module Replacement (HMR), making development much faster!

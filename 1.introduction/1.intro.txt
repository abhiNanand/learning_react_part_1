What is React?
React is a javacript library used for buidling user interface, mainly for single page application (SPA's). 
It is component based;
Component- Component is a reusable, independent piece of UI. It is like building block that helps in creating complex UIs by combining multiple smaller parts.
Eg-

function Greeting() {
  return <h1>Hello, World!</h1>;
}

Why did we need react?
-before react it was hard to build web application.
-DOM Manipulation was Slow - Updating the UI manually with Javascript (using document.getElementById or document.querySelector) was inefficient.
-Messy Code -  Large applications had a lot of code mixed together, making it hard to manage and debug.
-No Reuseability - Developers had to rewrite the same UI code in different places.
-Difficult State Management -  Keeping track of UI changes and user interactions was complicated.

How React Solves these problem?
✅ Fast UI Updates (Virtual DOM) – React updates only the changed parts of the page, making apps faster.
✅ Component-Based Architecture – UI is divided into small, reusable parts (components), making code clean and manageable.
✅ One-Way Data Flow – React keeps track of data changes and updates the UI automatically, reducing errors.
✅ Easy to Learn & Use – React uses JavaScript and JSX (similar to HTML), making it developer-friendly.
In short, React makes web development faster, cleaner, and more efficient! 

Main Points:
Fast UI Updates: React ka Virtual DOM sirf badle huye parts ko update karta hai, jo faster hota hai.
Component-Based Architecture: React me UI components hote hain, jo reusable aur easy to manage hote hain.
State Management: React me useState, useReducer jese hooks hote hain, jo efficiently state handle karte hain.
Routing & SPA: React page reload kiye bina content change kar sakta hai (React Router use karke).


Sandboxes for react - A sandbox is an isolated testing environment that enables users to run programs or open files

Installation
____________

to create project call my-app, run this command

Create a new React App- npx create-react-app my-app
Navigate to Your Project   - cd my-app
Start the React App- npm start


If you've previously installed create-react-app globally via npm install -g create-react-app, we recommend you uninstall the package using npm uninstall -g create-react-app or yarn global remove create-react-app to ensure that npx always uses the latest version.

✅ With TypeScript:
npx create-react-app my-app --template typeScript


by using vite we can also create 
________________________________

npm create vite@latest my-app
cd my-app
npm install
npm run dev

Much faster than create-react-app.
✔️ Supports React, TypeScript, Vue, Svelte, and more.

✅ With TypeScript:
npm create vite@latest my-app --template react-ts

Which One Should You Choose?
🏆 Beginner → create-react-app
⚡ Faster Dev Experience → Vite
🔧 Custom Setup → Manual Configuration

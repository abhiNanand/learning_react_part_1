UseState
________

useState is a React Hook that lets you add a state variable to your component.

const [state, setState] = useState(initialState)
-initial state ke jagah function v pass kar saktey hai,koi v types pass kar saktey hai.
-initial state is ignored after first render.
-If you pass a function as initialState, it will be treated as an initializer function. It should be pure, should take no arguments, and should return a value of any type.

-can only call at top level of component
-can't call it inside loops or conditons
-If you need that, extract a new component and move the state into it.
-In Strict Mode, React will call your initializer function twice
-set functions do not have a return value.

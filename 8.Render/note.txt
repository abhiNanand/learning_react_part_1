“Rendering” means that React is calling your component, which is a function.

Render and Commit
_________________ 

Before your components are displayed on screen, they must be rendered by React. 

What is "Render" in React?
In react rendering means calling a component  function to determine what should be shown on screen.
It happens whenever 
1. a componenet appear on screen for first time-initial render done by createRoot in index.js.
2. A component state or prop change,
3. A component parent rerender, causing child to re-render. 

How to Optimize Rendering?
Since React re-renders components when state or props change, excessive renders can affect performance. Here’s how to optimize:

🔹 Use React.memo → Prevents re-renders if props haven’t changed.
Use useCallback & useMemo → Prevents unnecessary function re-creation in renders.

Key Takeaways
✅ Rendering means React calls a component function to determine what should be displayed.
✅ State and prop changes trigger re-renders.
✅ React efficiently updates the UI using a virtual DOM diffing process.
✅ Optimizations like React.memo and useCallback can prevent unnecessary renders.
